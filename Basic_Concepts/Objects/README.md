# Objects
  
Objects are variables that are storing more values, (properties). Objects are a part of the world of Object Oriented Programming, a way of programming that is highly recommended to learn more about it.

## Objects

In our example for objects we used the following code:  
  

    var person = {
        name: "Bucky",
        age: 87
    }; 

   
  That is the typical syntax of  javascripts object as well:
    
    var objectname = {
	    property1: "property1valueinstringformat",
	    property2: property2valueinarithmeticformat
	    };

We achieve to insert more values in one variable by turning it to an object and by use the "property" format to each of our value
	

	    { property: valueofproperty };

  Curley brackets are defining the are of the properties, and also they defining that our variable is an object, and we separate our properties with the comma symbol.

##Javascript functions

According to W3schools:  
  
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).  

    function myFunction(p1, p2) {
        return p1 * p2;              // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
    }

###**JavaScript Function Syntax**  
  
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}  

      
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
        code to be executed
    }


Function **parameters** are the **names** listed in the function definition.

Function **arguments** are the real **values** received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments behave as local variables.
