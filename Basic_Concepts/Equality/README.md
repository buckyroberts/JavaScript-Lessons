# Equality
  
Equality is when we use comparison  operators to find out if both left and right compared value are equal, (AKA the same).

## Comparison, (and logical), Operators

In the code that we used  
  

    var a = '26';
    var b = 26;
    
    console.log(a==b); // true (only checks value)
    console.log(a===b); // false (compares type as well)

  
  Things are straight forward, as we explain the use of equal sign as comparison  operator to find out if:
    
 **a==b** the values in both a and b, (variables) are the same  
 and  
 **a===b** both the values and the type of a and b variables are the same.
  
In order to have a better understanding of logical operators here are few more examples of comparison and logical operators.  
  

-  **!=**	not equal  values between a and b (left and right variable/statement).
-   **!==**	not equal value or not equal type  between a and b (left and right variable/statement).
-   **>**	Left statement greater than right statement. 
-   **<** Left statement 	less than right statement. 
-   **>=** 	left statement greater than or equal to right  statement.   and
-   **<=**	 Left statement less than or equal to right statement.

##Javascript functions

According to W3schools:  
  
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).  

    function myFunction(p1, p2) {
        return p1 * p2;              // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
    }

###**JavaScript Function Syntax**  
  
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}  

      
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
        code to be executed
    }


Function **parameters** are the **names** listed in the function definition.

Function **arguments** are the real **values** received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments behave as local variables.
