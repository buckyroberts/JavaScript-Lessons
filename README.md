  - joining multiple arrays
  - iterator functions
  - es6 array features
  - sorting
  - searching
  - displaying as string
- stacks
- queue

- sets
- dictionaries
- hash tables
- map
- weakmap & weakset
- trees
- graphs
- sorting algorithms
- searching algorithms
- recursion
- greedy algorithms
- big o / algorithm complexity
